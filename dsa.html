    <h2>Wondering what Data Structures and Algorithms are?🤨</h2>
    <p>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.</p>

    <p>An algorithm is a process or a set of rules required to perform calculations or some other problem-solving operations especially by a computer. The formal definition of an algorithm is that it contains the finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task.</p>
    <h4>Confused?😧</h4>
    <p>In simple language,A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.</p>
    <p>An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. One common example of an algorithm is a recipe, which consists of specific instructions for preparing a dish or meal. Every computerized device uses algorithms to perform its functions.</p>
    <h3>IMPORTANT points to remember--></h3>
    <ol>
        <li> DSA is fundamental and is the most important skill that is tested out during placement at any company or any position you are applying for.</li>
        <li>The first and important concept step is to choose any one language in which you are comfortable and get a good command over it.</li>
        <li>Try to understand what is complexity and types of complexity. Mainly there are two, space complexity and Time complexity. Try writing down the codes and calculate its space and time complexities.</li>
        <li>Do not jump into the ocean of DSA without forming a proper strategy. You will find a pool of DSA questions on the internet, don’t get lost.</li>
        <li>Prepare a list of important questions/topics/concepts.</li>
        <li>Prepare a well-organized roadmap for your daily practice.</li>
        <li>For a month, try to solve 2-3 questions daily and make this a habit.(MORE IF YOU CAN)</li>
        <li>After you have solved the problem, analyze it completely, speak aloud and walk yourself through the naive to most optimised solution of the problem.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Estimate the time and space complexities</li>
            <li>Check for any repetitive or unnecessary loops.</li>
            <li>Decreasing the time complexity with increment of space utilisation (Trade-off between space and time)</li>
            <li>Scrap this solution and think about new one.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Practice is the key to excel in coding.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Never memorize the code.</li>
            <li>Understand the logic and practice the same code at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>And finally, code with passion. Never give up. It might be tough but keep on pushing yourself. You'll soon get there.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Do not skip any of the topics/concepts</li>
    </ol>
